    34	CHAPTER I.
    35	Down the Rabbit-Hole


    36	Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
    37	bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
    38	the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
    39	conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
    40	“without pictures or conversations?”

    41	So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
    42	hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
    43	making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
    44	picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
    45	close by her.

    46	There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
    47	so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
    48	dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
    49	it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
    50	time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
    51	watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
    52	on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
    53	had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
    54	watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
    55	field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
    56	large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

    57	In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
    58	in the world she was to get out again.

    59	The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
    60	dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
    61	about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
    62	deep well.

    63	Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
    64	plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
    65	was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
    66	what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
    67	looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
    68	cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
    69	hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    70	passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
    71	disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
    72	of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
    73	cupboards as she fell past it.

    74	“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
    75	think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
    76	at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
    77	top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)

    78	Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how
    79	many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
    80	getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
    81	be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
    82	several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
    83	though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
    84	knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
    85	practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
    86	then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
    87	idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
    88	grand words to say.)

    89	Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
    90	the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
    91	with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
    92	glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
    93	the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
    94	country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
    95	(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re
    96	falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
    97	an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
    98	to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”

    99	Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
   100	talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”
   101	(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
   102	tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
   103	no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
   104	very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here
   105	Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
   106	dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and
   107	sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer
   108	either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
   109	that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
   110	walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
   111	“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,
   112	thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
   113	the fall was over.

   114	Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
   115	she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
   116	long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
   117	it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
   118	and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears
   119	and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she
   120	turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
   121	herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
   122	from the roof.

   123	There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
   124	Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
   125	door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
   126	get out again.

   127	Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
   128	glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s
   129	first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
   130	but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
   131	but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
   132	time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
   133	behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
   134	little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

   135	Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
   136	much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
   137	passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
   138	out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
   139	flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
   140	through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought
   141	poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
   142	how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
   143	knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
   144	happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
   145	indeed were really impossible.

   146	There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
   147	back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
   148	any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
   149	time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here
   150	before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
   151	label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large
   152	letters.

   153	It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was
   154	not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,
   155	“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read
   156	several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
   157	eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
   158	_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
   159	such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
   160	and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
   161	bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
   162	bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
   163	sooner or later.

   164	However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to
   165	taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
   166	flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
   167	hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

   168	*      *      *      *      *      *      *

   169	    *      *      *      *      *      *

   170	*      *      *      *      *      *      *


   171	“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
   172	telescope.”

   173	And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
   174	brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
   175	through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
   176	waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
   177	she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”
   178	said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
   179	wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the
   180	flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
   181	not remember ever having seen such a thing.

   182	After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
   183	into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
   184	door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
   185	went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
   186	it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
   187	best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
   188	and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
   189	sat down and cried.

   190	“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
   191	rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
   192	gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
   193	and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
   194	her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
   195	cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
   196	for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
   197	“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two
   198	people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
   199	person!”

   200	Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
   201	she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
   202	“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said
   203	Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
   204	makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll
   205	get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”

   206	She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which
   207	way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
   208	growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
   209	size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
   210	had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
   211	things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
   212	on in the common way.

   213	So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

   214	*      *      *      *      *      *      *

   215	    *      *      *      *      *      *

   216	*      *      *      *      *      *      *




   217	CHAPTER II.
   218	The Pool of Tears


   219	“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
   220	for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m
   221	opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”
   222	(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
   223	sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I
   224	wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m
   225	sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
   226	myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
   227	kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
   228	want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
   229	Christmas.”

   230	And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must
   231	go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending
   232	presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

   233	     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
   234	     Alice’s love_).

   235	Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”

   236	Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
   237	now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
   238	key and hurried off to the garden door.

   239	Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
   240	look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
   241	hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

   242	“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
   243	you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop
   244	this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
   245	gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
   246	four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

   247	After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
   248	she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
   249	Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
   250	in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
   251	great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
   252	Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt
   253	so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
   254	Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,
   255	sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
   256	the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

   257	Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
   258	kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How
   259	queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
   260	I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
   261	same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
   262	a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
   263	in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began
   264	thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
   265	herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

   266	“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long
   267	ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t
   268	be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
   269	very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how
   270	puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
   271	Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
   272	and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
   273	rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try
   274	Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
   275	Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been
   276	changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she
   277	crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
   278	to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
   279	did not come the same as they used to do:—

   280	“How doth the little crocodile
   281	    Improve his shining tail,
   282	And pour the waters of the Nile
   283	    On every golden scale!

   284	“How cheerfully he seems to grin,
   285	    How neatly spread his claws,
   286	And welcome little fishes in
   287	    With gently smiling jaws!”


   288	“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes
   289	filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and
   290	I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
   291	no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve
   292	made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be
   293	no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’
   294	I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
   295	then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down
   296	here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden
   297	burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
   298	_very_ tired of being all alone here!”

   299	As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
   300	that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while
   301	she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be
   302	growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure
   303	herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
   304	now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
   305	found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
   306	dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

   307	“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
   308	sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and
   309	now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little
   310	door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
   311	key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than
   312	ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this
   313	before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”

   314	As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
   315	splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
   316	she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by
   317	railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
   318	her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
   319	to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
   320	sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
   321	of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
   322	soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
   323	she was nine feet high.

   324	“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying
   325	to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
   326	being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
   327	sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”

   328	Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
   329	off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
   330	it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
   331	she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
   332	slipped in like herself.

   333	“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
   334	Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
   335	likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she
   336	began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
   337	of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
   338	way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
   339	she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of
   340	a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather
   341	inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
   342	but it said nothing.

   343	“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s
   344	a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all
   345	her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
   346	anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which
   347	was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
   348	sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
   349	fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
   350	had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like
   351	cats.”

   352	“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would
   353	_you_ like cats if you were me?”

   354	“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
   355	about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
   356	take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
   357	quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
   358	in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
   359	paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
   360	nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
   361	pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
   362	over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk
   363	about her any more if you’d rather not.”

   364	“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
   365	tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
   366	_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
   367	again!”

   368	“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
   369	conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not
   370	answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
   371	our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
   372	know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
   373	you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
   374	of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
   375	know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says
   376	it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
   377	“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away
   378	from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
   379	pool as it went.

   380	So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
   381	won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the
   382	Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
   383	was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
   384	trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
   385	history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”

   386	It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
   387	birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
   388	Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
   389	led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




   390	CHAPTER III.
   391	A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


   392	They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the
   393	birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
   394	to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

   395	The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
   396	consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
   397	natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
   398	she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
   399	with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am
   400	older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow
   401	without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
   402	tell its age, there was no more to be said.

   403	At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
   404	called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make
   405	you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
   406	Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
   407	felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

   408	“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This
   409	is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William
   410	the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
   411	to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
   412	accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
   413	Mercia and Northumbria—’”

   414	“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.

   415	“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did
   416	you speak?”

   417	“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.

   418	“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,
   419	the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
   420	Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”

   421	“Found _what_?” said the Duck.

   422	“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know
   423	what ‘it’ means.”

   424	“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the
   425	Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
   426	archbishop find?”

   427	The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found
   428	it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
   429	the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
   430	of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,
   431	turning to Alice as it spoke.

   432	“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to
   433	dry me at all.”

   434	“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move
   435	that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
   436	remedies—”

   437	“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half
   438	those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And
   439	the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
   440	tittered audibly.

   441	“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,
   442	that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”

   443	“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to
   444	know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
   445	speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

   446	“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,
   447	as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
   448	tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

   449	First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact
   450	shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed
   451	along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and
   452	away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
   453	liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
   454	when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
   455	again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all
   456	crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”

   457	This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
   458	thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
   459	forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
   460	pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
   461	said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”

   462	“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.

   463	“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
   464	finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
   465	confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”

   466	Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
   467	pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
   468	not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
   469	one a-piece, all round.

   470	“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.

   471	“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in
   472	your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.

   473	“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.

   474	“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.

   475	Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
   476	presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant
   477	thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
   478	cheered.

   479	Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
   480	that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
   481	to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
   482	she could.

   483	The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
   484	confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
   485	theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
   486	However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
   487	begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

   488	“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why
   489	it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
   490	would be offended again.

   491	“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
   492	sighing.

   493	“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder
   494	at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on
   495	puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
   496	tale was something like this:—

   497	         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both
   498	         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no
   499	         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve
   500	         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear
   501	         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’
   502	         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll
   503	         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”

   504	“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are
   505	you thinking of?”

   506	“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth
   507	bend, I think?”

   508	“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

   509	“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
   510	anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”

   511	“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
   512	walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”

   513	“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,
   514	you know!”

   515	The Mouse only growled in reply.

   516	“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and
   517	the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only
   518	shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

   519	“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
   520	quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
   521	her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
   522	_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little
   523	snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”

   524	“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
   525	addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”

   526	“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the
   527	Lory.

   528	Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
   529	“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you
   530	can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
   531	she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”

   532	This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
   533	birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
   534	carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air
   535	doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
   536	to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in
   537	bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
   538	alone.

   539	“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy
   540	tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best
   541	cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
   542	any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
   543	lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
   544	little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
   545	eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
   546	coming back to finish his story.




   547	CHAPTER IV.
   548	The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


   549	It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
   550	anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
   551	it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
   552	my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
   553	ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a
   554	moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
   555	gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
   556	they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
   557	her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
   558	little door, had vanished completely.

   559	Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
   560	called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
   561	doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
   562	a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
   563	at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
   564	mistake it had made.

   565	“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How
   566	surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him
   567	his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she
   568	came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
   569	plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without
   570	knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
   571	real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
   572	fan and gloves.

   573	“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for
   574	a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she
   575	began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come
   576	here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,
   577	nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I
   578	don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
   579	if it began ordering people about like that!”

   580	By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
   581	in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
   582	pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
   583	gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
   584	little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
   585	this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it
   586	and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to
   587	happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so
   588	I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large
   589	again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”

   590	It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
   591	drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
   592	and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
   593	down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t
   594	grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t
   595	drunk quite so much!”

   596	Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
   597	and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
   598	was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
   599	one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
   600	Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
   601	of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I
   602	can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”

   603	Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
   604	and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
   605	seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
   606	again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

   607	“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t
   608	always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
   609	rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
   610	yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
   611	_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
   612	that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
   613	one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
   614	when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a
   615	sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”

   616	“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am
   617	now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but
   618	then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”

   619	“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn
   620	lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
   621	for any lesson-books!”

   622	And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
   623	making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
   624	she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

   625	“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”
   626	Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
   627	the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
   628	house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
   629	large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

   630	Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
   631	the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,
   632	that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll
   633	go round and get in at the window.”

   634	“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
   635	she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
   636	hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
   637	but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
   638	from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
   639	cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

   640	Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And
   641	then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging
   642	for apples, yer honour!”

   643	“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and
   644	help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)

   645	“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”

   646	“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)

   647	“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
   648	window!”

   649	“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”

   650	“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”

   651	There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
   652	now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
   653	all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her
   654	hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
   655	_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number
   656	of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what
   657	they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
   658	_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”

   659	She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
   660	rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
   661	talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other
   662	ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!
   663	fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
   664	together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do
   665	well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
   666	rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!
   667	Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I
   668	fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do
   669	it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says
   670	you’re to go down the chimney!”

   671	“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to
   672	herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in
   673	Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
   674	I _think_ I can kick a little!”

   675	She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
   676	she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)
   677	scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
   678	saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited
   679	to see what would happen next.

   680	The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”
   681	then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then
   682	silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy
   683	now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
   684	us all about it!”

   685	Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought
   686	Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
   687	a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
   688	like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”

   689	“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.

   690	“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice
   691	called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”

   692	There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I
   693	wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the
   694	roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
   695	Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”

   696	“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
   697	for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
   698	window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to
   699	this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that
   700	again!” which produced another dead silence.

   701	Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
   702	little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
   703	head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make
   704	_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it
   705	must make me smaller, I suppose.”

   706	So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
   707	began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
   708	through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
   709	little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
   710	was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
   711	something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
   712	appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
   713	safe in a thick wood.

   714	“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
   715	wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the
   716	second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
   717	will be the best plan.”

   718	It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
   719	arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
   720	how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
   721	the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
   722	great hurry.

   723	An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
   724	feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little
   725	thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
   726	it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
   727	might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
   728	spite of all her coaxing.

   729	Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
   730	held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
   731	all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
   732	and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
   733	to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
   734	other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
   735	over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
   736	very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
   737	moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
   738	the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
   739	little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
   740	all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
   741	its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

   742	This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
   743	set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
   744	and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

   745	“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant
   746	against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
   747	leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
   748	only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that
   749	I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
   750	suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
   751	question is, what?”

   752	The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
   753	the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
   754	looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
   755	There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
   756	herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
   757	behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
   758	was on the top of it.

   759	She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
   760	mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
   761	caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
   762	smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
   763	anything else.




   764	CHAPTER V.
   765	Advice from a Caterpillar


   766	The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
   767	silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
   768	addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

   769	“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.

   770	This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
   771	rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
   772	who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
   773	changed several times since then.”

   774	“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain
   775	yourself!”

   776	“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
   777	not myself, you see.”

   778	“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.

   779	“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,
   780	“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
   781	different sizes in a day is very confusing.”

   782	“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.

   783	“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you
   784	have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
   785	after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little
   786	queer, won’t you?”

   787	“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.

   788	“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know
   789	is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”

   790	“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”

   791	Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
   792	Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_
   793	short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I
   794	think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”

   795	“Why?” said the Caterpillar.

   796	Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
   797	good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
   798	state of mind, she turned away.

   799	“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something
   800	important to say!”

   801	This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

   802	“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.

   803	“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
   804	could.

   805	“No,” said the Caterpillar.

   806	Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
   807	and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
   808	some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
   809	its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you
   810	think you’re changed, do you?”

   811	“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
   812	used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”

   813	“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.

   814	“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all
   815	came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

   816	“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.

   817	Alice folded her hands, and began:—

   818	“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
   819	    “And your hair has become very white;
   820	And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
   821	    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”

   822	“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
   823	    “I feared it might injure the brain;
   824	But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
   825	    Why, I do it again and again.”

   826	“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
   827	    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   828	Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
   829	    Pray, what is the reason of that?”

   830	“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
   831	    “I kept all my limbs very supple
   832	By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
   833	    Allow me to sell you a couple?”

   834	“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
   835	    For anything tougher than suet;
   836	Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
   837	    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”

   838	“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
   839	    And argued each case with my wife;
   840	And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
   841	    Has lasted the rest of my life.”

   842	“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
   843	    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   844	Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
   845	    What made you so awfully clever?”

   846	“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
   847	    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
   848	Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
   849	    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”


   850	“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.

   851	“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the
   852	words have got altered.”

   853	“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,
   854	and there was silence for some minutes.

   855	The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

   856	“What size do you want to be?” it asked.

   857	“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one
   858	doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”

   859	“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.

   860	Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
   861	before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

   862	“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.

   863	“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t
   864	mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”

   865	“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,
   866	rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

   867	“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
   868	thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily
   869	offended!”

   870	“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the
   871	hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

   872	This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
   873	minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
   874	yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
   875	mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
   876	“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
   877	grow shorter.”

   878	“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to
   879	herself.

   880	“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
   881	aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

   882	Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
   883	trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
   884	perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
   885	last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
   886	off a bit of the edge with each hand.

   887	“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
   888	the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
   889	violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

   890	She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
   891	that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
   892	set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
   893	so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
   894	mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
   895	lefthand bit.

   896	*      *      *      *      *      *      *

   897	    *      *      *      *      *      *

   898	*      *      *      *      *      *      *


   899	“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which
   900	changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
   901	were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
   902	an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
   903	sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

   904	“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my
   905	shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”
   906	She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
   907	except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

   908	As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
   909	she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
   910	her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
   911	had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
   912	going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
   913	the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
   914	hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
   915	face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

   916	“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.

   917	“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”

   918	“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
   919	tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing
   920	seems to suit them!”

   921	“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.

   922	“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
   923	hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those
   924	serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”

   925	Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
   926	saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

   927	“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;
   928	“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
   929	haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”

   930	“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to
   931	see its meaning.

   932	“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the
   933	Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I
   934	should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
   935	from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”

   936	“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”

   937	“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to
   938	invent something!”

   939	“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
   940	the number of changes she had gone through that day.

   941	“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
   942	contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
   943	_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s
   944	no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
   945	tasted an egg!”

   946	“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
   947	child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
   948	know.”

   949	“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then
   950	they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”

   951	This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
   952	minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re
   953	looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
   954	me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”

   955	“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not
   956	looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want
   957	_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”

   958	“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
   959	down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
   960	as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
   961	and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
   962	she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
   963	and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
   964	the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
   965	she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

   966	It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
   967	felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
   968	and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan
   969	done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m
   970	going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my
   971	right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
   972	_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly
   973	upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
   974	“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them
   975	_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she
   976	began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
   977	near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




   978	CHAPTER VI.
   979	Pig and Pepper


   980	For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
   981	to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
   982	wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
   983	otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
   984	fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
   985	another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
   986	frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
   987	all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
   988	about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

   989	The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
   990	nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
   991	saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the
   992	Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
   993	tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.
   994	An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”

   995	Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

   996	Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
   997	for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
   998	Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
   999	door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

  1000	Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

  1001	“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for
  1002	two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you
  1003	are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could
  1004	possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
  1005	noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
  1006	and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
  1007	pieces.

  1008	“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”

  1009	“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on
  1010	without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,
  1011	if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
  1012	know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
  1013	this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
  1014	she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
  1015	head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”
  1016	she repeated, aloud.

  1017	“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”

  1018	At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
  1019	skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,
  1020	and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

  1021	“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
  1022	as if nothing had happened.

  1023	“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

  1024	“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first
  1025	question, you know.”

  1026	It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
  1027	dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.
  1028	It’s enough to drive one crazy!”

  1029	The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
  1030	remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for
  1031	days and days.”

  1032	“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.

  1033	“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.

  1034	“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s
  1035	perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.

  1036	The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
  1037	one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
  1038	in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
  1039	stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

  1040	“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to
  1041	herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

  1042	There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
  1043	occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
  1044	alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen
  1045	that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
  1046	on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

  1047	“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
  1048	not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why
  1049	your cat grins like that?”

  1050	“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”

  1051	She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
  1052	jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
  1053	baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—

  1054	“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
  1055	know that cats _could_ grin.”

  1056	“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”

  1057	“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite
  1058	pleased to have got into a conversation.

  1059	“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”

  1060	Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
  1061	be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
  1062	was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
  1063	fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
  1064	the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a
  1065	shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
  1066	them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
  1067	that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

  1068	“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down
  1069	in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an
  1070	unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
  1071	off.

  1072	“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse
  1073	growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”

  1074	“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to
  1075	get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just
  1076	think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
  1077	earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”

  1078	“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”

  1079	Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
  1080	the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
  1081	be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
  1082	is it twelve? I—”

  1083	“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide
  1084	figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
  1085	sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
  1086	the end of every line:

  1087	“Speak roughly to your little boy,
  1088	    And beat him when he sneezes:
  1089	He only does it to annoy,
  1090	    Because he knows it teases.”


  1091	CHORUS.
  1092	(In which the cook and the baby joined):


  1093	“Wow! wow! wow!”


  1094	While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
  1095	the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
  1096	that Alice could hardly hear the words:—

  1097	“I speak severely to my boy,
  1098	    I beat him when he sneezes;
  1099	For he can thoroughly enjoy
  1100	    The pepper when he pleases!”


  1101	CHORUS.


  1102	“Wow! wow! wow!”


  1103	“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
  1104	flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play
  1105	croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook
  1106	threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

  1107	Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
  1108	little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
  1109	“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was
  1110	snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
  1111	itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
  1112	the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

  1113	As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
  1114	twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
  1115	ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
  1116	out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”
  1117	thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
  1118	murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the
  1119	little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
  1120	“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of
  1121	expressing yourself.”

  1122	The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
  1123	to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
  1124	a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
  1125	its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
  1126	not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only
  1127	sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
  1128	were any tears.

  1129	No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”
  1130	said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
  1131	now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
  1132	to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

  1133	Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
  1134	with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so
  1135	violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
  1136	there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
  1137	a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
  1138	further.

  1139	So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
  1140	trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to
  1141	herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
  1142	rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other
  1143	children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
  1144	to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she
  1145	was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
  1146	a tree a few yards off.

  1147	The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
  1148	thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
  1149	felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

  1150	“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
  1151	whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
  1152	wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.
  1153	“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

  1154	“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

  1155	“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.

  1156	“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

  1157	“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.

  1158	“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long
  1159	enough.”

  1160	Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
  1161	question. “What sort of people live about here?”

  1162	“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives
  1163	a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a
  1164	March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”

  1165	“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.

  1166	“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.
  1167	You’re mad.”

  1168	“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.

  1169	“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”

  1170	Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
  1171	do you know that you’re mad?”

  1172	“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”

  1173	“I suppose so,” said Alice.

  1174	“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,
  1175	and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,
  1176	and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”

  1177	“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.

  1178	“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the
  1179	Queen to-day?”

  1180	“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited
  1181	yet.”

  1182	“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.

  1183	Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
  1184	things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
  1185	it suddenly appeared again.

  1186	“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly
  1187	forgotten to ask.”

  1188	“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
  1189	in a natural way.

  1190	“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.

  1191	Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
  1192	appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
  1193	which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she
  1194	said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
  1195	perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
  1196	was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
  1197	again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

  1198	“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.

  1199	“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
  1200	and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”

  1201	“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
  1202	beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
  1203	remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

  1204	“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
  1205	grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”

  1206	She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
  1207	the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
  1208	chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
  1209	was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
  1210	nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
  1211	to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
  1212	timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
  1213	I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”




  1214	CHAPTER VII.
  1215	A Mad Tea-Party


  1216	There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
  1217	March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
  1218	between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
  1219	cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very
  1220	uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,
  1221	I suppose it doesn’t mind.”

  1222	The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
  1223	one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw
  1224	Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and
  1225	she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

  1226	“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

  1227	Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
  1228	“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.

  1229	“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.

  1230	“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.

  1231	“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said
  1232	the March Hare.

  1233	“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
  1234	many more than three.”

  1235	“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at
  1236	Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
  1237	speech.

  1238	“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some
  1239	severity; “it’s very rude.”

  1240	The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
  1241	was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”

  1242	“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve
  1243	begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.

  1244	“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said
  1245	the March Hare.

  1246	“Exactly so,” said Alice.

  1247	“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.

  1248	“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
  1249	say—that’s the same thing, you know.”

  1250	“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well
  1251	say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”

  1252	“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what
  1253	I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”

  1254	“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
  1255	talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing
  1256	as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”

  1257	“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the
  1258	conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
  1259	Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
  1260	writing-desks, which wasn’t much.

  1261	The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month
  1262	is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
  1263	pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
  1264	and holding it to his ear.

  1265	Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”

  1266	“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit
  1267	the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

  1268	“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.

  1269	“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:
  1270	“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”

  1271	The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
  1272	it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
  1273	nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,
  1274	you know.”

  1275	Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a
  1276	funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t
  1277	tell what o’clock it is!”

  1278	“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what
  1279	year it is?”

  1280	“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it
  1281	stays the same year for such a long time together.”

  1282	“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.

  1283	Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no
  1284	sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite
  1285	understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.

  1286	“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little
  1287	hot tea upon its nose.

  1288	The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
  1289	eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”

  1290	“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice
  1291	again.

  1292	“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”

  1293	“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.

  1294	“Nor I,” said the March Hare.

  1295	Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the
  1296	time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no
  1297	answers.”

  1298	“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk
  1299	about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”

  1300	“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.

  1301	“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head
  1302	contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”

  1303	“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat
  1304	time when I learn music.”

  1305	“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.
  1306	Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything
  1307	you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in
  1308	the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
  1309	hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
  1310	time for dinner!”

  1311	(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

  1312	“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I
  1313	shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”

  1314	“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to
  1315	half-past one as long as you liked.”

  1316	“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.

  1317	The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We
  1318	quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing
  1319	with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert
  1320	given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

  1321	‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
  1322	How I wonder what you’re at!’


  1323	You know the song, perhaps?”

  1324	“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.

  1325	“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—

  1326	‘Up above the world you fly,
  1327	Like a tea-tray in the sky.
  1328	                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”


  1329	Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
  1330	“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they
  1331	had to pinch it to make it stop.

  1332	“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the
  1333	Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his
  1334	head!’”

  1335	“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.

  1336	“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t
  1337	do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”

  1338	A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many
  1339	tea-things are put out here?” she asked.

  1340	“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,
  1341	and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”

  1342	“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.

  1343	“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”

  1344	“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured
  1345	to ask.

  1346	“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
  1347	“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”

  1348	“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the
  1349	proposal.

  1350	“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And
  1351	they pinched it on both sides at once.

  1352	The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a
  1353	hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”

  1354	“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.

  1355	“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.

  1356	“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again
  1357	before it’s done.”

  1358	“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began
  1359	in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
  1360	they lived at the bottom of a well—”

  1361	“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest
  1362	in questions of eating and drinking.

  1363	“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
  1364	two.

  1365	“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;
  1366	“they’d have been ill.”

  1367	“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”

  1368	Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
  1369	living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But
  1370	why did they live at the bottom of a well?”

  1371	“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

  1372	“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t
  1373	take more.”

  1374	“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to
  1375	take _more_ than nothing.”

  1376	“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.

  1377	“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.

  1378	Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
  1379	some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
  1380	repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”

  1381	The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
  1382	said, “It was a treacle-well.”

  1383	“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
  1384	Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily
  1385	remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
  1386	yourself.”

  1387	“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I
  1388	dare say there may be _one_.”

  1389	“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
  1390	go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,
  1391	you know—”

  1392	“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

  1393	“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

  1394	“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place
  1395	on.”

  1396	He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
  1397	moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
  1398	place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
  1399	advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
  1400	before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

  1401	Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
  1402	cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
  1403	from?”

  1404	“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should
  1405	think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”

  1406	“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
  1407	to notice this last remark.

  1408	“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”

  1409	This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
  1410	some time without interrupting it.

  1411	“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
  1412	its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of
  1413	things—everything that begins with an M—”

  1414	“Why with an M?” said Alice.

  1415	“Why not?” said the March Hare.

  1416	Alice was silent.

  1417	The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
  1418	doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
  1419	little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as
  1420	mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
  1421	things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a
  1422	drawing of a muchness?”

  1423	“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t
  1424	think—”

  1425	“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.

  1426	This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
  1427	great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
  1428	neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
  1429	looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
  1430	the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
  1431	the teapot.

  1432	“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her
  1433	way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
  1434	all my life!”

  1435	Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
  1436	leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But
  1437	everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And
  1438	in she went.

  1439	Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
  1440	glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,
  1441	and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
  1442	led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
  1443	(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
  1444	high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found
  1445	herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
  1446	and the cool fountains.




  1447	CHAPTER VIII.
  1448	The Queen’s Croquet-Ground


  1449	A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
  1450	growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
  1451	painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
  1452	went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
  1453	one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me
  1454	like that!”

  1455	“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my
  1456	elbow.”

  1457	On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the
  1458	blame on others!”

  1459	“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
  1460	yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”

  1461	“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.

  1462	“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.

  1463	“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
  1464	bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”

  1465	Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust
  1466	things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
  1467	them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
  1468	and all of them bowed low.

  1469	“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are
  1470	painting those roses?”

  1471	Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
  1472	voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
  1473	_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
  1474	was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
  1475	you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this
  1476	moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
  1477	out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw
  1478	themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
  1479	and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

  1480	First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
  1481	three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
  1482	corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
  1483	diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
  1484	the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
  1485	jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
  1486	ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
  1487	and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
  1488	hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
  1489	by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
  1490	the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
  1491	grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  1492	Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
  1493	like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
  1494	of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a
  1495	procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their
  1496	faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,
  1497	and waited.

  1498	When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
  1499	at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the
  1500	Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

  1501	“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
  1502	Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”

  1503	“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;
  1504	but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after
  1505	all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”

  1506	“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
  1507	who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
  1508	their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
  1509	the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
  1510	or courtiers, or three of her own children.

  1511	“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s
  1512	no business of _mine_.”

  1513	The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
  1514	moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”

  1515	“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
  1516	silent.

  1517	The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my
  1518	dear: she is only a child!”

  1519	The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn
  1520	them over!”

  1521	The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

  1522	“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
  1523	gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
  1524	the royal children, and everybody else.

  1525	“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,
  1526	turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing
  1527	here?”

  1528	“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going
  1529	down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”

  1530	“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
  1531	“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the
  1532	soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
  1533	to Alice for protection.

  1534	“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large
  1535	flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
  1536	minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
  1537	others.

  1538	“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.

  1539	“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted
  1540	in reply.

  1541	“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”

  1542	The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
  1543	evidently meant for her.

  1544	“Yes!” shouted Alice.

  1545	“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
  1546	wondering very much what would happen next.

  1547	“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was
  1548	walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

  1549	“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”

  1550	“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
  1551	anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
  1552	tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under
  1553	sentence of execution.”

  1554	“What for?” said Alice.

  1555	“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.

  1556	“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
  1557	‘What for?’”

  1558	“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
  1559	scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
  1560	tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
  1561	Queen said—”

  1562	“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
  1563	people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
  1564	other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
  1565	began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
  1566	in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
  1567	hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
  1568	themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

  1569	The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
  1570	she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
  1571	under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
  1572	had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
  1573	hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
  1574	up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
  1575	bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
  1576	going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
  1577	had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
  1578	this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
  1579	wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
  1580	always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
  1581	soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

  1582	The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
  1583	all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
  1584	the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
  1585	shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a
  1586	minute.

  1587	Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
  1588	dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
  1589	“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
  1590	fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
  1591	one left alive!”

  1592	She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
  1593	could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
  1594	appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
  1595	watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
  1596	to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
  1597	to.”

  1598	“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
  1599	enough for it to speak with.

  1600	Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
  1601	speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
  1602	of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
  1603	down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
  1604	she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
  1605	was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

  1606	“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
  1607	complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
  1608	oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
  1609	least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
  1610	confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
  1611	arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
  1612	ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
  1613	it ran away when it saw mine coming!”

  1614	“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.

  1615	“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
  1616	that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
  1617	“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”

  1618	The Queen smiled and passed on.

  1619	“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
  1620	looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.

  1621	“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
  1622	introduce it.”

  1623	“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may
  1624	kiss my hand if it likes.”

  1625	“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.

  1626	“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
  1627	that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.

  1628	“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
  1629	but I don’t remember where.”

  1630	“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called
  1631	the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would
  1632	have this cat removed!”

  1633	The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
  1634	small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.

  1635	“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he
  1636	hurried off.

  1637	Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
  1638	on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with
  1639	passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
  1640	executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
  1641	of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
  1642	whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

  1643	The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
  1644	to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
  1645	other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
  1646	the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
  1647	helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

  1648	By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
  1649	was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t
  1650	matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side
  1651	of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
  1652	escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
  1653	friend.

  1654	When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
  1655	a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
  1656	the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
  1657	while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

  1658	The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
  1659	the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
  1660	all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
  1661	what they said.

  1662	The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
  1663	there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
  1664	thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.

  1665	The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
  1666	beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.

  1667	The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in
  1668	less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
  1669	this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
  1670	anxious.)

  1671	Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
  1672	Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”

  1673	“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”
  1674	And the executioner went off like an arrow.

  1675	The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
  1676	time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
  1677	the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
  1678	while the rest of the party went back to the game.




  1679	CHAPTER IX.
  1680	The Mock Turtle’s Story


  1681	“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”
  1682	said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,
  1683	and they walked off together.

  1684	Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
  1685	to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
  1686	savage when they met in the kitchen.

  1687	“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
  1688	tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
  1689	does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people
  1690	hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
  1691	kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
  1692	them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
  1693	sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be
  1694	so stingy about it, you know—”

  1695	She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
  1696	startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking
  1697	about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
  1698	tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
  1699	a bit.”

  1700	“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.

  1701	“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only
  1702	you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as
  1703	she spoke.

  1704	Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
  1705	Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
  1706	right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
  1707	uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
  1708	bore it as well as she could.

  1709	“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up
  1710	the conversation a little.

  1711	“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
  1712	’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”

  1713	“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
  1714	their own business!”

  1715	“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her
  1716	sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of
  1717	_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
  1718	themselves.’”

  1719	“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to
  1720	herself.

  1721	“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”
  1722	the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
  1723	the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”

  1724	“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
  1725	to have the experiment tried.

  1726	“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
  1727	the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”

  1728	“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.

  1729	“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of
  1730	putting things!”

  1731	“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.

  1732	“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
  1733	everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.
  1734	And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is
  1735	of yours.’”

  1736	“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
  1737	remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”

  1738	“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that
  1739	is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more
  1740	simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
  1741	appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
  1742	otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
  1743	otherwise.’”

  1744	“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,
  1745	“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”

  1746	“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,
  1747	in a pleased tone.

  1748	“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said
  1749	Alice.

  1750	“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present
  1751	of everything I’ve said as yet.”

  1752	“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give
  1753	birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
  1754	loud.

  1755	“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
  1756	little chin.

  1757	“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
  1758	feel a little worried.

  1759	“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and
  1760	the m—”

  1761	But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,
  1762	even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was
  1763	linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
  1764	Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
  1765	thunderstorm.

  1766	“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

  1767	“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the
  1768	ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in
  1769	about half no time! Take your choice!”

  1770	The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

  1771	“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
  1772	much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
  1773	croquet-ground.

  1774	The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were
  1775	resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
  1776	back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay
  1777	would cost them their lives.

  1778	All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
  1779	with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with
  1780	her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
  1781	soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
  1782	that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
  1783	all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
  1784	and under sentence of execution.

  1785	Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have
  1786	you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”

  1787	“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”

  1788	“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.

  1789	“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.

  1790	“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”

  1791	As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
  1792	to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a
  1793	good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
  1794	number of executions the Queen had ordered.

  1795	They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
  1796	you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
  1797	thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock
  1798	Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
  1799	executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
  1800	with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
  1801	but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
  1802	as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

  1803	The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
  1804	she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,
  1805	half to itself, half to Alice.

  1806	“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.

  1807	“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never
  1808	executes nobody, you know. Come on!”

  1809	“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly
  1810	after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”

  1811	They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
  1812	sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
  1813	nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
  1814	pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the
  1815	Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all
  1816	his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”

  1817	So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
  1818	full of tears, but said nothing.

  1819	“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your
  1820	history, she do.”

  1821	“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit
  1822	down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”

  1823	So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
  1824	herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”
  1825	But she waited patiently.

  1826	“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real
  1827	Turtle.”

  1828	These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
  1829	occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant
  1830	heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
  1831	saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not
  1832	help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
  1833	nothing.

  1834	“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
  1835	though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the
  1836	sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”

  1837	“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.

  1838	“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle
  1839	angrily: “really you are very dull!”

  1840	“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
  1841	question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
  1842	at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
  1843	Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all
  1844	day about it!” and he went on in these words:

  1845	“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”

  1846	“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.

  1847	“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.

  1848	“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
  1849	The Mock Turtle went on.

  1850	“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”

  1851	“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so
  1852	proud as all that.”

  1853	“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

  1854	“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”

  1855	“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.

  1856	“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.

  1857	“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a
  1858	tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
  1859	‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”

  1860	“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom
  1861	of the sea.”

  1862	“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I
  1863	only took the regular course.”

  1864	“What was that?” inquired Alice.

  1865	“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle
  1866	replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
  1867	Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”

  1868	“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”

  1869	The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of
  1870	uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”

  1871	“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”

  1872	“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify
  1873	is, you _are_ a simpleton.”

  1874	Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
  1875	she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”

  1876	“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
  1877	subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
  1878	Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
  1879	that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
  1880	Fainting in Coils.”

  1881	“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.

  1882	“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too
  1883	stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”

  1884	“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,
  1885	though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”

  1886	“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught
  1887	Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”

  1888	“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
  1889	creatures hid their faces in their paws.

  1890	“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry
  1891	to change the subject.

  1892	“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so
  1893	on.”

  1894	“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.

  1895	“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
  1896	“because they lessen from day to day.”

  1897	This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
  1898	before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been
  1899	a holiday?”

  1900	“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.

  1901	“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.

  1902	“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very
  1903	decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”




  1904	CHAPTER X.
  1905	The Lobster Quadrille


  1906	The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
  1907	his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
  1908	two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”
  1909	said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
  1910	the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
  1911	running down his cheeks, he went on again:—

  1912	“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said
  1913	Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”
  1914	(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and
  1915	said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
  1916	Lobster Quadrille is!”

  1917	“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”

  1918	“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the
  1919	sea-shore—”

  1920	“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
  1921	then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”

  1922	“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.

  1923	“—you advance twice—”

  1924	“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.

  1925	“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”

  1926	“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.

  1927	“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”

  1928	“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

  1929	“—as far out to sea as you can—”

  1930	“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.

  1931	“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
  1932	about.

  1933	“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

  1934	“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock
  1935	Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
  1936	been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
  1937	sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

  1938	“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.

  1939	“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.

  1940	“Very much indeed,” said Alice.

  1941	“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the
  1942	Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”

  1943	“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”

  1944	So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
  1945	then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
  1946	forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
  1947	and sadly:—

  1948	“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
  1949	“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
  1950	See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
  1951	They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
  1952	Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
  1953	Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

  1954	“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
  1955	When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
  1956	But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
  1957	Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
  1958	Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
  1959	Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

  1960	“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
  1961	“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
  1962	The further off from England the nearer is to France—
  1963	Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
  1964	Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
  1965	Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”


  1966	“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,
  1967	feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that
  1968	curious song about the whiting!”

  1969	“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,
  1970	of course?”

  1971	“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself
  1972	hastily.

  1973	“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve
  1974	seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”

  1975	“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in
  1976	their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”

  1977	“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would
  1978	all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
  1979	and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
  1980	eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.

  1981	“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the
  1982	lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
  1983	fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
  1984	couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”

  1985	“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much
  1986	about a whiting before.”

  1987	“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you
  1988	know why it’s called a whiting?”

  1989	“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”

  1990	“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

  1991	Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated
  1992	in a wondering tone.

  1993	“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what
  1994	makes them so shiny?”

  1995	Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
  1996	answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”

  1997	“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
  1998	“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”

  1999	“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

  2000	“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
  2001	“any shrimp could have told you that.”

  2002	“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still
  2003	running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
  2004	please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”

  2005	“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no
  2006	wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”

  2007	“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

  2008	“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,
  2009	and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”

  2010	“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.

  2011	“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
  2012	the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”

  2013	“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said
  2014	Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
  2015	because I was a different person then.”

  2016	“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.

  2017	“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
  2018	“explanations take such a dreadful time.”

  2019	So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
  2020	saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
  2021	the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
  2022	their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
  2023	went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
  2024	about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the
  2025	Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
  2026	Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”

  2027	“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.

  2028	“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I
  2029	should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
  2030	begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
  2031	authority over Alice.

  2032	“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the
  2033	Gryphon.

  2034	“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”
  2035	thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got
  2036	up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
  2037	Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
  2038	very queer indeed:—

  2039	“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  2040	“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
  2041	As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  2042	Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”

  2043	[later editions continued as follows
  2044	When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  2045	And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  2046	But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  2047	His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


  2048	“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said
  2049	the Gryphon.

  2050	“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds
  2051	uncommon nonsense.”

  2052	Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
  2053	wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

  2054	“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.

  2055	“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next
  2056	verse.”

  2057	“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn
  2058	them out with his nose, you know?”

  2059	“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully
  2060	puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

  2061	“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it
  2062	begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”

  2063	Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
  2064	wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—

  2065	“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  2066	How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”

  2067	[later editions continued as follows
  2068	The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  2069	While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  2070	When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  2071	Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  2072	While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  2073	And concluded the banquet—]


  2074	“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
  2075	interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the
  2076	most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”

  2077	“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was
  2078	only too glad to do so.

  2079	“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon
  2080	went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”

  2081	“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice
  2082	replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
  2083	“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old
  2084	fellow?”

  2085	The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
  2086	with sobs, to sing this:—

  2087	“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
  2088	Waiting in a hot tureen!
  2089	Who for such dainties would not stoop?
  2090	Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
  2091	Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
  2092	    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
  2093	    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
  2094	Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
  2095	    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

  2096	“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
  2097	Game, or any other dish?
  2098	Who would not give all else for two p
  2099	ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
  2100	Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
  2101	    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
  2102	    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
  2103	Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
  2104	    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”


  2105	“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
  2106	to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the
  2107	distance.

  2108	“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
  2109	off, without waiting for the end of the song.

  2110	“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
  2111	answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
  2112	came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—

  2113	“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
  2114	    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”




  2115	CHAPTER XI.
  2116	Who Stole the Tarts?


  2117	The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
  2118	arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little
  2119	birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
  2120	standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
  2121	him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
  2122	hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
  2123	court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
  2124	good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d
  2125	get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”
  2126	But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
  2127	everything about her, to pass away the time.

  2128	Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
  2129	about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
  2130	the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to
  2131	herself, “because of his great wig.”

  2132	The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
  2133	wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
  2134	did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

  2135	“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”
  2136	(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were
  2137	animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She
  2138	said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
  2139	proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
  2140	girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”
  2141	would have done just as well.

  2142	The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are
  2143	they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything
  2144	to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”

  2145	“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,
  2146	“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”

  2147	“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
  2148	stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
  2149	court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
  2150	to make out who was talking.

  2151	Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
  2152	that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,
  2153	and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
  2154	“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
  2155	muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.

  2156	One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
  2157	could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
  2158	very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
  2159	that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
  2160	at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
  2161	was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
  2162	was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

  2163	“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.

  2164	On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
  2165	unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—

  2166	“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
  2167	    All on a summer day:
  2168	The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
  2169	    And took them quite away!”


  2170	“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.

  2171	“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great
  2172	deal to come before that!”

  2173	“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
  2174	three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”

  2175	The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
  2176	and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your
  2177	Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished
  2178	my tea when I was sent for.”

  2179	“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”

  2180	The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
  2181	court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
  2182	was,” he said.

  2183	“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.

  2184	“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.

  2185	“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
  2186	wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
  2187	reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

  2188	“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.

  2189	“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.

  2190	“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
  2191	a memorandum of the fact.

  2192	“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none
  2193	of my own. I’m a hatter.”

  2194	Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
  2195	who turned pale and fidgeted.

  2196	“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
  2197	have you executed on the spot.”

  2198	This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
  2199	from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
  2200	confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
  2201	bread-and-butter.

  2202	Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
  2203	her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
  2204	grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
  2205	the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
  2206	as long as there was room for her.

  2207	“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting
  2208	next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”

  2209	“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”

  2210	“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.

  2211	“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing
  2212	too.”

  2213	“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in
  2214	that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
  2215	to the other side of the court.

  2216	All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
  2217	just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
  2218	of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”
  2219	on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
  2220	off.

  2221	“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you
  2222	executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”

  2223	“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
  2224	“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
  2225	bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”

  2226	“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.

  2227	“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.

  2228	“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you
  2229	take me for a dunce? Go on!”

  2230	“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after
  2231	that—only the March Hare said—”

  2232	“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

  2233	“You did!” said the Hatter.

  2234	“I deny it!” said the March Hare.

  2235	“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”

  2236	“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking
  2237	anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
  2238	nothing, being fast asleep.

  2239	“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”

  2240	“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.

  2241	“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.

  2242	“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”

  2243	The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
  2244	down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.

  2245	“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.

  2246	Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
  2247	the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
  2248	explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
  2249	up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
  2250	head first, and then sat upon it.)

  2251	“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in
  2252	the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
  2253	applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
  2254	court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”

  2255	“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the
  2256	King.

  2257	“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”

  2258	“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.

  2259	Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

  2260	“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get
  2261	on better.”

  2262	“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
  2263	the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

  2264	“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
  2265	without even waiting to put his shoes on.

  2266	“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the
  2267	officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
  2268	to the door.

  2269	“Call the next witness!” said the King.

  2270	The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
  2271	her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
  2272	court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

  2273	“Give your evidence,” said the King.

  2274	“Shan’t,” said the cook.

  2275	The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
  2276	“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”

  2277	“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
  2278	after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
  2279	nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”

  2280	“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.

  2281	“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.

  2282	“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!
  2283	Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
  2284	whiskers!”

  2285	For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
  2286	turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
  2287	disappeared.

  2288	“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the
  2289	next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my
  2290	dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
  2291	forehead ache!”

  2292	Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
  2293	very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they
  2294	haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her
  2295	surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
  2296	little voice, the name “Alice!”




  2297	CHAPTER XII.
  2298	Alice’s Evidence


  2299	“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
  2300	large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
  2301	a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
  2302	upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
  2303	they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
  2304	goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

  2305	“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
  2306	began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
  2307	of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
  2308	idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
  2309	jury-box, or they would die.

  2310	“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until
  2311	all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated
  2312	with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

  2313	Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
  2314	the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
  2315	tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
  2316	got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she
  2317	said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
  2318	trial one way up as the other.”

  2319	As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
  2320	upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
  2321	them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
  2322	accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
  2323	anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
  2324	court.

  2325	“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.

  2326	“Nothing,” said Alice.

  2327	“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.

  2328	“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.

  2329	“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were
  2330	just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
  2331	Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he
  2332	said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
  2333	he spoke.

  2334	“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on
  2335	to himself in an undertone,

  2336	“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying
  2337	which word sounded best.

  2338	Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”
  2339	Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
  2340	“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.

  2341	At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
  2342	his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule
  2343	Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”

  2344	Everybody looked at Alice.

  2345	“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.

  2346	“You are,” said the King.

  2347	“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.

  2348	“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a
  2349	regular rule: you invented it just now.”

  2350	“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.

  2351	“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.

  2352	The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your
  2353	verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

  2354	“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the
  2355	White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been
  2356	picked up.”

  2357	“What’s in it?” said the Queen.

  2358	“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a
  2359	letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”

  2360	“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to
  2361	nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”

  2362	“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.

  2363	“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s
  2364	nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
  2365	and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”

  2366	“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.

  2367	“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest
  2368	thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)

  2369	“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury
  2370	all brightened up again.)

  2371	“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they
  2372	can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”

  2373	“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter
  2374	worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
  2375	your name like an honest man.”

  2376	There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
  2377	clever thing the King had said that day.

  2378	“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.

  2379	“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know
  2380	what they’re about!”

  2381	“Read them,” said the King.

  2382	The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please
  2383	your Majesty?” he asked.

  2384	“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you
  2385	come to the end: then stop.”

  2386	These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

  2387	“They told me you had been to her,
  2388	    And mentioned me to him:
  2389	She gave me a good character,
  2390	    But said I could not swim.

  2391	He sent them word I had not gone
  2392	    (We know it to be true):
  2393	If she should push the matter on,
  2394	    What would become of you?

  2395	I gave her one, they gave him two,
  2396	    You gave us three or more;
  2397	They all returned from him to you,
  2398	    Though they were mine before.

  2399	If I or she should chance to be
  2400	    Involved in this affair,
  2401	He trusts to you to set them free,
  2402	    Exactly as we were.

  2403	My notion was that you had been
  2404	    (Before she had this fit)
  2405	An obstacle that came between
  2406	    Him, and ourselves, and it.

  2407	Don’t let him know she liked them best,
  2408	    For this must ever be
  2409	A secret, kept from all the rest,
  2410	    Between yourself and me.”


  2411	“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the
  2412	King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”

  2413	“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so
  2414	large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of
  2415	interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s
  2416	an atom of meaning in it.”

  2417	The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s
  2418	an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the
  2419	paper.

  2420	“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of
  2421	trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t
  2422	know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
  2423	them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
  2424	“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning
  2425	to the Knave.

  2426	The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he
  2427	certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

  2428	“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the
  2429	verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of
  2430	course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he
  2431	did with the tarts, you know—”

  2432	“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.

  2433	“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
  2434	tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
  2435	again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I
  2436	think?” he said to the Queen.

  2437	“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
  2438	as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
  2439	slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
  2440	began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
  2441	as it lasted.)

  2442	“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the
  2443	court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

  2444	“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
  2445	laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for
  2446	about the twentieth time that day.

  2447	“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”

  2448	“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the
  2449	sentence first!”

  2450	“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.

  2451	“I won’t!” said Alice.

  2452	“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
  2453	moved.

  2454	“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
  2455	this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”

  2456	At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
  2457	her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
  2458	tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
  2459	head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
  2460	leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

  2461	“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve
  2462	had!”

  2463	“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her
  2464	sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
  2465	Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
  2466	had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious
  2467	dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”
  2468	So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
  2469	what a wonderful dream it had been.


  2470	But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
  2471	hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
  2472	her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
  2473	and this was her dream:—

  2474	First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
  2475	hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
  2476	looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
  2477	see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
  2478	that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
  2479	seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
  2480	strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.

  2481	The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
  2482	frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she
  2483	could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
  2484	shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
  2485	ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
  2486	was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
  2487	around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
  2488	Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
  2489	filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
  2490	Turtle.

  2491	So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
  2492	Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
  2493	would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
  2494	wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
  2495	teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
  2496	cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
  2497	shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
  2498	(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
  2499	lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
  2500	Turtle’s heavy sobs.

  2501	Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
  2502	would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
  2503	keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
  2504	childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
  2505	and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
  2506	perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
  2507	would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
  2508	their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
  2509	days.

  2515	Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
  2516	law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
  2517	so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
  2518	States without permission and without paying copyright
  2519	royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
  2520	of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

  2526	copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
  2527	easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

  2553	or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

  2554	1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
  2555	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
  2556	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
  2557	things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
  2558	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
  2559	paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
  2560	Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
  2561	agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
  2562	electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

  2563	1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
  2564	Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
  2565	of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
  2566	works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
  2567	States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
  2568	United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
  2569	claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
  2570	displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
  2571	all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
  2572	that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
  2573	free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
  2574	works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
  2575	Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
  2576	comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
  2577	same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
  2578	you share it without charge with others.

  2579	1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
  2580	what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
  2581	in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
  2582	check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
  2583	agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
  2584	distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
  2585	other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
  2586	representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
  2587	country other than the United States.

  2588	1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

  2589	1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
  2590	immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear

  2593	phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
  2594	performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  2596	    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
  2597	    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
  2598	    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
  2599	    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
  2600	    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
  2601	    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  2602	  
  2603	1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
  2604	derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
  2605	contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
  2606	copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
  2607	the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
  2608	redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
  2609	Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
  2610	either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

  2615	must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
  2616	additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

  2620	1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
  2621	License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
  2622	work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

  2623	1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
  2624	electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
  2625	prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
  2626	active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
  2627	Gutenberg™ License.

  2628	1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
  2629	compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
  2630	any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
  2631	to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
  2632	other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
  2633	version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
  2634	(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
  2635	to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
  2636	of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
  2637	Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
  2638	full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  2639	1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
  2640	performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
  2641	unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

  2642	1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
  2643	access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
  2644	provided that:

  2645	    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  2646	        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  2647	        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  2648	        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  2649	        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  2650	        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  2651	        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  2652	        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  2653	        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  2654	        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  2655	        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  2656	        Literary Archive Foundation.”
  2657	    
  2658	    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  2659	        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  2660	        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  2661	        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  2662	        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  2663	        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  2664	        works.
  2665	    
  2666	    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  2667	        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  2668	        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  2669	        receipt of the work.
  2670	    
  2671	    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  2672	        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
  2673	    

  2674	1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
  2675	Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
  2676	are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
  2677	from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
  2678	the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
  2679	forth in Section 3 below.

  2680	1.F.

  2681	1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
  2682	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
  2683	works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
  2684	Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
  2685	electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
  2686	contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
  2687	or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
  2688	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
  2689	other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
  2690	cannot be read by your equipment.

  2691	1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
  2692	of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
  2693	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
  2694	Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
  2695	Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
  2696	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
  2697	fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
  2698	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
  2699	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
  2700	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
  2701	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
  2702	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  2703	DAMAGE.

  2704	1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
  2705	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
  2706	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
  2707	written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
  2708	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
  2709	with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
  2710	with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
  2711	lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
  2712	or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
  2713	opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
  2714	the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
  2715	without further opportunities to fix the problem.

  2716	1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
  2717	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
  2718	OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
  2719	LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

  2720	1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
  2721	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
  2722	damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
  2723	violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
  2724	agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
  2725	limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
  2726	unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
  2727	remaining provisions.

  2728	1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
  2729	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
  2730	providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
  2731	accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
  2732	production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
  2733	electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
  2734	including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
  2735	the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
  2736	or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
  2737	additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
  2738	Defect you cause.

  2739	Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

  2740	Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
  2741	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
  2742	computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
  2743	exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
  2744	from people in all walks of life.

  2745	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
  2746	assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
  2747	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
  2748	remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
  2749	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
  2750	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
  2751	generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
  2752	Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
  2753	Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

  2754	Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

  2755	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
  2756	501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
  2757	state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
  2758	Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
  2759	number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
  2760	Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
  2761	U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

  2762	The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
  2763	Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
  2764	to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
  2765	and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

  2766	Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
  2767	Literary Archive Foundation

  2768	Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
  2769	public support and donations to carry out its mission of
  2770	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
  2771	freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
  2772	array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
  2773	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
  2774	status with the IRS.

  2775	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
  2776	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
  2777	States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
  2778	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
  2779	with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
  2780	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
  2781	DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
  2782	visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

  2783	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
  2784	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
  2785	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
  2786	approach us with offers to donate.

  2787	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
  2788	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
  2789	outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

  2790	Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
  2791	methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
  2792	ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
  2793	donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

  2794	Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

  2795	Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
  2796	Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
